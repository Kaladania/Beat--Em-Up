algorithm optimization changes:

- removed the 'player_spawn' function
	- found it unnessicary to have the player spawn in a random area each iteration
	- still intended for the player to drop from the air as the small delay worked as 	 	  makeshift transistion

- removed horizontonal collision check
	- this type of game does not include barriers or hills the player would need to 	  	jump over, therefore the check is not needed

- SFX for attack and shoot moved to object methods in order to be applied to both enemy and fighter

- (removed the co-op. Add it in evaluation as a future bonus feature)



Bug Fixes:
- added the condition that the idle animation couldn't play mid air (stops enimies from standing still while falling)



QoL improvements:

- increased the damaged dealt by player shooting (from 20 to 50)
- increased the damaged dealt by enemy shooting (from 5 default to 7 after 15 points)
- changed attack and shoot key from space/up to i/j for a better UX
